# ATLA-Network
A study of character networks induced from the transcripts of the series Avatar: The Last Airbender.
The main file is the atla_analyzer.py. You *should* only have to run that one.
Make sure all the files are in the same folder/directory.


If you came from the Old Bit Waves video, hello there o/


## Questions?

Q: "Your code doesn't work on my machine. How can I fix that?"  
A: First make sure you're running it with Python 3. The files here are not a 1-1 copy of what I have on my local machine, so I'm still working on what exactly I need to put here to get this thing going.

Q: "Can I use your code on some project that I'm working on?"  
A: Yeah no problem. Just please credit me somewhere along the way :)

Q: "Will you improve your code? Will you implement X feature to better analyze/create the network?"  
A: The answer is a 'maybe' at best. If one day I get some inspiration and suddenly start working on it again then yes I'll improve it bit by bit.

Q: "Why did this thing into a video?"  
A: I initially wanted to post it somewhere online, maybe on Reddit. But I felt that I could express my ideas better through a video format.

Q: "Why did you take *so long* to make the video?"  
A: Simple. I'm dumb and inexperienced.
